# Name of the project

> Vertigo Rock Climbing

Vertigo Rock climbing is a rock climbing project in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. I helped out working for these guys as a bit of a mountain guide from 2019 to 2022. While I was learning to program, it seemed only fitting that one of my projects would be for Vertigo, and for rock climbing.
